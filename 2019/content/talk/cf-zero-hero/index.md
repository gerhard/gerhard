title: "From Zero to Hero"
summary: Training workshop on deploying and managing applications on Cloud Foundry
abstract: |
    Join us for a hands-on training workshop to learn about deploying and managing applications on Cloud Foundry.

    We will give an overview of Cloud Foundry and how it works, including specifics relating to services, buildpacks, and architecture.

    We will also look at how to effectively work with Cloud Foundry in your organisation.

    This training is targeted at people with little or no Cloud Foundry experience but some experience delivering web-based applications.

    If you are curious to learn how Cloud Foundry can help you focus on development and innovation, rather than infrastructure plumbing, this is the right course for you.
