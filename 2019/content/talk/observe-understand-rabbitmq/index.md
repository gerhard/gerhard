title: Observe and Understand RabbitMQ
summary: RabbitMQ 3.8 ships observability features that make it easy to understand what happens in the different layers of this complex, distributed stateful system. We will share why what we had didn't work, how we went about rethinking our approach to metrics and the unexpected benefits that we have uncovered while on this journey.

# FEEDBACK for MK

* Add PerfTest dashboard
* Clarify the first Grafana graph - axes, etc.
* Make it clearer that these are 3.8 features only
* Emphasize that everybody needs to upgrade to 3.8 - these features are not available in 3.7

* Mention that Mirrors & Slaves are used interchangly - ask Michael
* Only mention Erlang-Memory-Allocators dashboard, do not go into any details
