# FEEDBACK for MK

* Add PerfTest dashboard
* Clarify the first Grafana graph - axes, etc.
* Make it clearer that these are 3.8 features only
* Emphasize that everybody needs to upgrade to 3.8 - these features are not available in 3.7

* Mention that Mirrors & Slaves are used interchangly - ask Michael
* Only mention Erlang-Memory-Allocators dashboard, do not go into any details
