title: A pipeline to get you excited
summary: A pipeline is the secret of happy & successful teams. Let me show you why.
abstract: |
  A hands-on training workshop where you will learn to visualise the code release process as a pipeline and experience the possibilities that this concept unlocks.

  You will start by building a simple pipeline that will continuously deploy a web app.
  Within minutes, you will make it production-ready:

  * new commits will automatically update your web app
  * app will be always available, even as new versions are being deployed
  * versions of your app that don't work won't be promoted to live
  * 10x scale outs at the click of a button

  In the second part of the workshop, you will see examples of pipelines that perform full production backups and manage entire infrastructures.
  You will even experience the most complex and advanced pipelines that deliver big software at scale.
