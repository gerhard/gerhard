title: Make Your System Observable RC
summary: Why should you? What happened when we did? **Improved by [DevOpsZH](https://twitter.com/DevOpsZH)**
abstract: |
  What does it mean for a system to be observable?

  Why is observability fundamental for all good systems?

  What is the impact of observability on end-users, support & engineering?

  We will use years of learnings from RabbitMQ & Concourse to answer these questions and show you how these products have addressed this essential requirement.

  To get the most out of this talk, it will help to know beforehand [what is RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/features.html) and [what is Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/docs.html).
