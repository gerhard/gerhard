# [Feature](#/1)

```nohighlight
As a CF hero
I want a new version of my app to show the same data
So that I can iterate on feedback from my users
```

---

## [Where does my app store](#/2) state[?](#/2)

In a service deployed alongside Cloud Foundry

Registered with CF through a [Service Broker](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html)

---

## [What is a](#/3) Service Broker[?](#/3)

A service for provisioning resources of a specific type

An API advertising a catalog of service offerings and plans

{{< speaker_note >}}
  Service Broker API is registered and used by the Cloud Controller
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

## [How do I see all available](#/4) <br />service offerings[?](#/4)

```bash
$ cf marketplace
```

```bash

## [I want a](#/5) Redis service instance

```bash
$ cf create-service rediscloud 30mb redis
```

```bash
$ cf services

name    service      plan   bound apps   last operation
redis   rediscloud   30mb                create succeeded
```

---

## [I want my app to](#/6) store state <br />in this Redis service instance

```bash
# From the training home directory:
$ cd 07-shared-state/stateful-app
$ cf push --no-start
```

```bash
$ cf bind-service stateful-app redis

App stateful-app is already bound to redis.
# Services can be defined in the app manifest
```

```bash
$ cf start stateful-app
```

<img src="/img/cf-zero-hero/shared-state-index.png" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" />

{{< speaker_note >}}
  Service can also be bound from manifest.yml (& has been!) These services must be created first.

  Demo app, see redis connectivity by refreshing page & incrementing view count
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

## [Are](#/7) all app instances <br />using the same Redis[?](#/7)

```bash
$ cf scale stateful-app -i 2
```

<img src="/img/cf-zero-hero/alt-index.png" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" />

---

## [How are](#/8) service details exposed to apps[?](#/8)

```bash
$ cf env stateful-app
...
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "rediscloud": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "hostname": "pub-redis-15708.us-east-1-4.6.ec2.redislabs.com",
     "password": "PASSWORD",
     "port": "15708"
    },
...
```

```
$ redis-cli -h pub-redis-15708...redislabs.com -p 15708 -a PASSWORD
pub-redis-15708.us-east-1-4.6.ec2.redislabs.com:15708> keys *
1) "9f397b68...total_instance_10.10.81.59:61500_responses"
2) "9f397b68...total_instance_10.10.17.49:61509_responses"
3) "9f397b68...total_app_responses"
```

```bash
pub-redis-15708.us-east-1-4.6.ec2.redislabs.com:15708> exit
```

---

## [Let's](#/9) iterate on user feedback

```bash
$ cf set-env stateful-app SHOW_APP_SUPPORTERS true
$ cf restart stateful-app
```

<img src="/img/cf-zero-hero/app-supporters.png" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" />

---

## App gets deleted [by mistake](#/10)

What actually happened: the CEO clicked some links.

```bash
$ cf delete -f -r stateful-app
```

We restore the app, much to our users' delight.

```
# From the training home directory:
$ cd 07-shared-state/stateful-app
$ cf push --no-start
$ cf set-env stateful-app SHOW_APP_SUPPORTERS true
$ cf start stateful-app
```

<img src="/img/cf-zero-hero/new-app-supporters.png" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" />

{{< speaker_note >}}
  The URL is different because we have pushed a new app
{{< /speaker_note >}}
