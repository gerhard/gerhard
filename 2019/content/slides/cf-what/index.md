  Open-source with an Apache license, hosted on GitHub.

  Developers use the cf command line utility to interact with a CF deployment.

  * <span style="color: #8FF541;">Cloud Computing</span> characterised as **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS**
  * Applications are the **PaaS** unit of currency
  * Heroku blazed a trail for **PaaS**

{{< speaker_note >}}
  IaaS - servers, SaaS - users.

  Heroku created patterns based on their experiences called "12 Factors" that have been heavily influencial. Also drove "buildpack" model

  Great learning opportunity through DIY.
  Takes a long time to master.
  BOSH has a steep learning curve.
  CF on bosh-lite requires 10GB of FREE RAM.
