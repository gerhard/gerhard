# [Feature](#/1)

```nohighlight
As a CF hero
I want to have a command line utility installed
So that I can deploy apps into my CF account
```

---

## [How do I](#/2) interact with CF[?](#/2)

From Terminal / Command Prompt

With CF CLI utility

{{< speaker_note >}}
  The CF CLI utility communicates with the Cloud Controller, a CF component, that exposes a RESTful API

  As all good things: from the terminal, using the CF CLI

  Popular IDEs come with plugins that allow you to deploy your app directly from the IDE

## [How do I](#/3) install the CF CLI[?](#/3)

[github.com/cloudfoundry/cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads)

<img src="/img/cf-zero-hero/cf-cli-downloads.png" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" />


{{< speaker_note >}}
  The v6 of the CLI is written in Go and ships as a self-contained binary

  Using an installer is easier and you are more likely to end up with a correctly working utility. It's the recommended approach.

  On the GitHub page, you want to click on the links in the first column, Stable Installers.

## [Did](#/4) CF CLI install [correctly?](#/4)

```bash
$ cf
NAME:
   cf - A command line tool to interact with Cloud Foundry

USAGE:
   [environment variables] cf [global options] command [arguments...

VERSION:
   6.13.0-e68ce0f-2015-10-15T22:53:29+00:00

BUILD TIME:
   2015-10-25 01:04:16.22807612 +0100 BST
...
```

{{< speaker_note >}}
  To open the command prompt in Windows, press the Windows key (or Ctrl + R), type cmd and press Enter key.

  If you type just cf with no command or arguments you will get a very long list of all supported commands

  DO NOT TYPE THE $ SYMBOL
{{< /speaker_note >}}

## [How do I](#/5) log into CF[?](#/5)

```bash
$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io -u YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS
```

```bash
$ cf help login
$ cf login -h
NAME:
   login - Log user in

USAGE:
   cf login [-a URL] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-o ORG] [-s SPACE]
...
```

{{< speaker_note >}}
  We already know that cf displays a list of all supported commands

  cf help login (or any supported command) will display info about that specific command

  cf login -h behaves the same

  CF API endpoint & username from Pivotal CF

## [What is a](#/6) CF space[?](#/6)

Every application and service is scoped to a space

```bash
$ cf spaces

slides
training
```

```bash
$ cf space training

development
    Org:               cf-hero
    Apps:              
    Domains:           
    Services:          
    Security Groups:   public_networks, dns, ssh-logging, p-mysql...
    Space Quota:
```

{{< speaker_note >}}
  Without a space, an application or service cannot be created

  A space provides a set of users access to a shared location for application development

  Each org must contain at least one space

  If an org contains a single space, that space will be automatically targeted

  If an org contains multiple spaces, a space needs to be explicitly selected

  Find info about your CF space
