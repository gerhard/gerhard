title: The Path to Continuous Delivery
summary: How to continuously deliver a containerized Rails application into production?
abstract: |
  The aim is to have an end-to-end process for continuously delivering a Rails application with MySQL and Redis dependencies into production, as a series of Docker containers, across multiple physical hosts.

  I will be able to preview features from git branches, in production, without affecting the active production instances.

  It goes without saying, all GitHub commits will trigger builds, as one would expect from a real Continuous Delivery setup.
