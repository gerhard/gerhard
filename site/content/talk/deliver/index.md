title: Deliver
summary: How do you consistently deliver code into production?
abstract: |
  As a developer, your job does not stop with writing clean, well-documented and well-tested code.
  You get paid for working, in production code.
  So how do you consistently deliver your code into production?
  How you make it part of your CI process?
  Does devops do it for you via Chef or Puppet?

  This talk is meant to explore the current deployment processes, present their strengths and weaknesses and provide a simple alternative.
  This alternative has no dependencies (no, not even Ruby) and can be applied in the same way to your trusted Rails, the hated PHP or your look-ma-no-tests node.js.
