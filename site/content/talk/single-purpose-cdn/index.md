title: Single-purpose CDN
summary: Why we started building our single-purpose CDN?
abstract: |
    Gerhard and his Changelog Media colleagues have been exploring ways to make
    http://changelog.com infrastructure simpler and easier to operate. While
    using a CDN provider may seem simpler, years of experience taught them a
    different lesson.

    In episode 18 (Kaizen 13) of the Changelog & Friends podcast, Gerhard, Adam
    & Jerod discussed the CDN issues that they have been having since late
    2023. The episode title captures that conversation well: Should we build a
    CDN? https://changelog.com/friends/26

    A few months later, they had the beginnings of a self-hosted CDN running in
    16 world-wide http://fly.io locations. You can watch that demo here:

    In this livestream, Gerhard will walk us through some of the CDN problems
    that they faced over the years, why they chose to start building their own
    CDN, and where they are currently at.
