title: 12 months of production time with Docker
summary: Is Docker on its own enough for production?
abstract: |
  Docker is fast, deterministic, and delivers really well on promises, but itâ€™s just a small piece of the puzzle.
  This talk is about the other missing pieces for a successful production environment run entirely in Docker containers, on dedicated hardware, with no PXE magic.

Gerhard Lazu works for Cloud Credo as a software engineer.
He only trusts things that he can understand - extra points if he has built them himself!
He takes time and care when putting systems together.
There are better things in life than debugging hot messes.
