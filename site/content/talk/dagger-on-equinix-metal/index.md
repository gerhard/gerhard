title: Dagger on Equinix Metal
summary: GoReleaser build workflow as a Dagger pipeline running on Equinix Metal
abstract: |
    Have you ever wanted to run your CI/CD pipeline locally, exactly as it runs in
    your CI platform of choice? I did, and it never worked well.

    What about running the same pipeline across multiple CI platforms to see which
    one suits you better? While I hold not one, but two PhDs in YAML, translating
    YAML between CI platforms is not something that I would recommend.

    In today's talk, we will learn about CI/CD pipelines as code & see my preferred
    way of running them on Equinix Metal.

    ```sh
    # View the slides:
    docker run -it registry.dagger.io/equinix-demo-day-2023

    # Browse the code:
    docker run -it --entrypoint nvim registry.dagger.io/equinix-demo-day-2023 .
    ```
